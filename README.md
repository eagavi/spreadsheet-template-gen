# spreadsheet-template-gen
Custom spreadsheet templates created with perl and Excel::Writer::XLSX üê™Ô∏è

### about

* This is not a project, but a collection of perl scripts I use to generate excel templates I use at work and/or my personal time. 
* The included script(s) are rather verbose so that future me can still understand what's happening.
* This repository rests on the shoulders of the [Excel::Writer::XLSX](https://metacpan.org/pod/Excel::Writer::XLSX) module

### usage

* clone or download the repository
* install the `Excel::Writer::XLSX` module via cpan or your package manager 
* on debian-based systems running the native perl installation: `sudo apt install libexcel-writer-xlsx-perl`
* execute the script you want with `perl scriptname.pl`
